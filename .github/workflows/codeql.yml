# CodeQL Security Analysis Pipeline
#
# This workflow performs automated security vulnerability detection using GitHub's CodeQL engine.
# It analyzes the codebase for potential security issues, coding errors, and code quality problems.
#
# Features:
# - Runs on every PR and push to main branch
# - Weekly scheduled scans on Sundays
# - JavaScript/TypeScript code analysis
# - Automated security alerts and reporting
#
# Usage:
# - Automatically triggered on code changes
# - Results appear in the Security tab under Code scanning alerts
# - Failed checks indicate potential security vulnerabilities that should be reviewed
# - No manual intervention required for routine scans
#
# For more information: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning
