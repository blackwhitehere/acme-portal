## Requirements

* Microsoft Python VSCode Extension needs to be installed
* Python environment used by your project needs to be selected with `Python: Select Interpreter` command
* Project needs to add as dependency & setup [`acme-portal-sdk`](https://blackwhitehere.github.io/acme-portal-sdk)
* `git` CLI needs to be installed
* Opened project needs to have remote source pointing to a `GitHub` repository (Other repos to be supported)

## Development

### Dev setup

* Go to `VSCode` `Run and Debug` tab and run `Run Extension` configuration.
* Open [`acme-prefect`](https://github.com/blackwhitehere/acme-prefect) repository which you have pulled locally.
* Create python virtual env according to instructions in the repo and set it using `Python: Select Interpreter`.

### Building and Testing

The project uses a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Check for unused dependencies
npm run knip

# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Run tests
npm test

# Package extension
npm run package

# Verify package integrity
npm run package-check
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes comprehensive CI/CD automation:

#### Continuous Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- **Multi-platform testing**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Multiple Node.js versions**: 18.x, 20.x  
- **Multiple VS Code versions**: stable, insiders
- **Quality checks**: ESLint, knip, npm audit
- **Automated packaging validation**

#### Security Scanning
- **CodeQL analysis** for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependabot** for automatic dependency updates
- **NPM audit** for known security issues

#### Release Automation (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Automated publishing** on git tags (`v*`)
- **GitHub releases** with extension assets
- **VS Code Marketplace publishing** (requires `VSCE_PAT` secret)
- **Package verification** before publishing

### Publishing

To publish a new version:

1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Create a git tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
3. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
4. The release workflow will automatically:
   - Run all tests and quality checks
   - Package the extension
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Publish to VS Code Marketplace (if configured)

Manual publishing:
```bash
# Package extension
npm run package

# Publish to marketplace (requires authentication)
npx vsce publish
```
