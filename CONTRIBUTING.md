# Contributing to ACME Portal

## Development Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Node.js 18.x or 20.x
   - VS Code
   - Git
   - Python (for testing with acme-portal-sdk)

2. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/blackwhitehere/acme-portal.git
   cd acme-portal
   npm install
   ```

3. **Development Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Start development server
   npm run watch
   
   # Run extension in new VS Code window
   # Press F5 or use "Run Extension" configuration
   ```

## Code Quality

### Linting and Formatting
```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Check for unused code/dependencies
npm run knip
```

### Building and Packaging
```bash
# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Bundle for production
npm run package

# Verify package
npm run package-check
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Note: Tests require VS Code environment
# Use "Extension Test Runner" in VS Code for interactive testing
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Checks
Every pull request automatically runs:
- **Multi-platform testing** (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- **Multiple Node.js versions** (18.x, 20.x)
- **Multiple VS Code versions** (stable, insiders)
- **Code quality checks** (ESLint, knip, audit)
- **Security scanning** (CodeQL)
- **Package verification**

### Branch Protection
The `main` branch is protected and requires:
- All CI checks to pass
- Code review approval
- Up-to-date branch

## Release Process

### Versioning
We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Breaking changes increment MAJOR
- New features increment MINOR  
- Bug fixes increment PATCH

### Release Notes Process

#### Contributing Changes to Release Notes
**Every pull request must include a release notes entry**. This ensures proper documentation of all changes and enables automated release generation.

1. **Add Your Change to CHANGELOG.md**
   - Open `CHANGELOG.md` 
   - Find the `## [Unreleased]` section at the top
   - Add your change under the appropriate subsection:
     - `### Added` - for new features
     - `### Changed` - for changes in existing functionality  
     - `### Deprecated` - for soon-to-be removed features
     - `### Removed` - for now removed features
     - `### Fixed` - for any bug fixes
     - `### Security` - for security-related changes

2. **Format Your Entry**
   ```markdown
   ### Added
   - **Feature Name**: Brief description of the change (#PR_NUMBER)
   ```
   
   **Examples:**
   ```markdown
   ### Added
   - **Deploy Progress Notifications**: Real-time progress updates during flow deployments (#42)
   
   ### Fixed
   - **Tree View Refresh**: Fixed issue where tree view wasn't updating after deployments (#43)
   
   ### Changed
   - **Settings UI**: Improved settings panel layout and validation (#44)
   ```

3. **Link Your Pull Request**
   - Always include the PR number in parentheses: `(#123)`
   - This creates automatic linking and enables automated validation

#### Release Notes Validation
- **CI Check**: Automated validation ensures all PRs are referenced in release notes
- **PR Requirements**: Your PR will fail CI if release notes entry is missing
- **Review Process**: Maintainers will verify release notes during code review

### Creating a Release
1. **Prepare Release Notes**
   - Review all entries in the `[Unreleased]` section
   - Ensure all changes are properly categorized and described
   - Verify all PR numbers are correct and linked

2. **Update Version**
   ```bash
   # Update package.json version
   npm version patch|minor|major
   ```

3. **Move Release Notes**
   - Create new version section in `CHANGELOG.md`
   - Move all items from `[Unreleased]` to the new version section
   - Add release date: `## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15`
   - Leave `[Unreleased]` section empty for future changes

4. **Create and Push Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

5. **Automated Release**
   - GitHub Actions will automatically:
     - Run all tests and quality checks
     - Bundle the extension
     - Extract release notes from `CHANGELOG.md`
     - Create GitHub release with proper release notes
     - Publish to VS Code Marketplace (if configured)

## Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Provide type annotations for public APIs
- Follow existing code patterns
- Document complex functions with JSDoc

### File Organization
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/          # VS Code command implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/           # Business logic actions
â”œâ”€â”€ treeView/          # Tree view providers and items
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ settings/          # Configuration management
â”œâ”€â”€ sdk/               # acme-portal-sdk integration
â””â”€â”€ test/              # Test files
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: camelCase for TypeScript files
- **Classes**: PascalCase
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with descriptive names

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

   npm test
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if needed
3. **Add release notes entry** in `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` section (required)
