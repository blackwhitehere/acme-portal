2. Open VS Code
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
4. Run "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
5. Select the downloaded `.vsix` file

### Option 3: Development Installation

2. Open the project in VS Code
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Press `F5` to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window

## Project Setup

### Setting Up acme-portal-sdk

Before using the extension, your Python project must be configured with the acme-portal-sdk. Follow the comprehensive setup guide in the [acme-portal-sdk documentation](https://blackwhitehere.github.io/acme-portal-sdk/).

**Quick Setup Summary:**

1. **Install the SDK**: `pip install acme-portal-sdk` 
2. **Initialize SDK in your project**: Run the SDK initialization command in your project root
3. **Configure your flows**: Set up your Python flows to work with the SDK
4. **Verify setup**: Ensure the `.acme_portal_sdk` directory exists in your project root

For a complete working example, see the [acme-prefect sample project](https://github.com/blackwhitehere/acme-prefect).

## Initial Configuration

### 1. Open Your Project

Open a folder or workspace that contains Python flows configured with the acme-portal-sdk.

**Requirements for the project:**
- Must be a Git repository with a remote origin
- Must contain a `.acme_portal_sdk` directory (created during SDK setup)
- Must have Python flows that are SDK-compatible
- Must have the acme-portal-sdk Python package installed

### 2. Configure Python Interpreter

The extension needs to access your Python environment where acme-portal-sdk is installed:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run "Python: Select Interpreter"
3. Choose the Python environment where acme-portal-sdk is installed
   - If using a virtual environment, make sure to select the interpreter from that environment
   - The path should show something like `/path/to/venv/bin/python` or similar

### 3. Configure Flows Directory

Tell the extension where to find your Python flows:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`)
2. Search for "acme portal"
3. Find "Acmeportal: Flows Path" setting
4. Set the path to your flows directory (relative to workspace root)
   - **Default**: `flows`
   - **Examples**: 
     - `src/flows` - flows in a src subdirectory
     - `my_flows` - custom flows directory name
     - `packages/flows` - flows in a packages subdirectory

### 4. Verify Extension Activation

1. Open the ACME Portal sidebar:
   - Click the ACME icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
   - Or use `View > Open View... > ACME Resources`

2. Check for the extension activation:
   - You should see "ACME Resources" view in the sidebar
   - The extension will show a welcome message if the workspace is not properly configured
   - If properly configured, you should see your flows listed in a tree structure

### 5. First-Time Setup Verification

After setup, verify everything is working:

1. **Check ACME Resources View**: Should display your flows in a tree structure
2. **Test Refresh**: Click the refresh button (ðŸ”„) in the ACME Resources toolbar
3. **Try Opening a Flow**: Click the file icon (ðŸ“„) next to a flow to open its source file
4. **Check Output Panel**: Look for "ACME Portal" in the Output panel for any error messages

## Troubleshooting Initial Setup

### Extension Not Loading

**Symptoms**: ACME Portal icon doesn't appear in Activity Bar, or views don't load

**Solutions**:
- Ensure VS Code version is 1.102.0 or later
- Check that the extension is properly installed in the Extensions view
- Restart VS Code
- Check the Output panel (select "ACME Portal") for error messages

### Welcome Message Shows Instead of Flows

**Symptoms**: Seeing "In order to use extension features, you need to open a folder..." message

**Solutions**:
- Ensure you've opened a folder/workspace containing a Git repository
- Check that the opened folder has a `.acme_portal_sdk` directory
- Verify the folder contains Python flows configured for the SDK

### No Flows Visible

**Symptoms**: ACME Resources view is empty or shows "No flows found"

**Solutions**:
- Verify the flows path in extension settings matches your project structure
- Ensure your flows are properly configured with acme-portal-sdk
- Check that Python interpreter points to environment with acme-portal-sdk installed
- Look for errors in Output panel (select "ACME Portal")
- Try refreshing with the refresh button (ðŸ”„)

### Python/SDK Issues

**Symptoms**: Errors related to Python execution or SDK modules

**Solutions**:
- Ensure Git CLI is installed and accessible from command line
- Verify Python interpreter selection points to correct environment
- Confirm acme-portal-sdk is installed in the selected Python environment
- Check that `.acme_portal_sdk` directory exists and contains required modules
- Review [acme-portal-sdk documentation](https://blackwhitehere.github.io/acme-portal-sdk/) for proper setup

### Permission or Path Issues

**Symptoms**: File access errors or path-related problems

**Solutions**:
- Ensure VS Code has proper permissions to access your project directory
- Check that flows path in settings uses forward slashes (even on Windows)
- Verify the flows path is relative to workspace root, not absolute
- Make sure the flows directory actually exists in your project

## Getting Help

If you continue to have issues:

1. **Check the Output Panel**: Select "ACME Portal" from the dropdown for detailed logs
2. **Review SDK Documentation**: Visit [acme-portal-sdk docs](https://blackwhitehere.github.io/acme-portal-sdk/)
3. **Check Sample Project**: Review the [acme-prefect example](https://github.com/blackwhitehere/acme-prefect)
4. **Report Issues**: Create an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/blackwhitehere/acme-portal/issues)

## First Steps

Once set up, you can:

- **Browse Flows**: View all flows in your project
- **Open Flow Files**: Click the file icon next to any flow
- **Deploy Flows**: Use the deploy button for flows ready for deployment
- **Promote Environments**: Move flows between environments
- **Compare Versions**: See differences between flow versions

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

- Ensure VS Code version is 1.97.0 or later
- Check that the Python extension is installed and active
- Restart VS Code

### No Flows Visible

- Verify the flows path in settings
- Ensure your project uses acme-portal-sdk
- Check that Python interpreter is selected
- Look for errors in the Output panel (select "ACME Portal" from the dropdown)

### Deployment Issues

- Ensure Git CLI is installed and accessible
- Check that your flows follow the required structure
- Verify SDK configuration
