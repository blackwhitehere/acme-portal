### Deployment Operations

#### Deploying Individual Flows

Deploy flows from your local workspace to target environments.

**Prerequisites for deployment:**

- Flow must be marked as deployable by the SDK
- Git repository must have a clean working state or committed changes
- Python environment must have acme-portal-sdk properly configured
- Target environment must be configured in the SDK

**How to deploy:**

1. **Via Context Menu**: 

   - Right-click on a deployable flow
   - Click "Deploy Flow" or the cloud upload icon (‚òÅÔ∏è)

2. **Via Command Palette**:

   - Select a flow in the tree
   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "ACME: Deploy Flow"

3. **Via Toolbar** (when flow is selected):

   - Click the deploy button in the context menu

**Deployment process:**

1. Extension validates prerequisites
2. Determines current Git branch/commit
3. Calls SDK's DeployWorkflow object
4. Shows progress notification
5. Updates tree view with new deployment status
6. Displays deployment URL if available

**Deployment parameters passed to SDK:**
- List of flows to deploy
- Git reference (branch/tag/commit)
- Additional context from flow metadata

#### Deploying Flow Groups

Deploy multiple flows at once by specifying a group path. This feature allows you to deploy all flows that belong to the same organizational group.

**What are Flow Groups?**

Flow groups are organizational structures defined in your flows using the `grouping` attribute. For example, if you have flows with grouping `["backend", "data", "etl"]`, they belong to the group path "backend/data/etl".

**Group Path Format:**
- Use forward slashes to separate group levels: `"aaa/bbb/ccc"`
- Matches flows with grouping `["aaa", "bbb", "ccc"]`
- Must match the exact grouping structure (no partial matches)

**How to deploy flow groups:**

1. **Via Command Palette**:

   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run "ACME: Deploy Flow Group"
   - Enter the group path (e.g., "backend/data/etl")
   - Review the list of flows that will be deployed
   - Confirm deployment

2. **Via Tree View Context Menu**:

   - Right-click on any group folder in the ACME Resources tree
   - Select "Deploy All Flows in Group" (cloud upload icon ‚òÅÔ∏è)
   - Review and confirm the deployment

**Group Deployment Process:**

1. Extension validates prerequisites (Git state, SDK configuration)
2. Finds all flows matching the exact group path
3. Shows confirmation dialog listing all flows to be deployed
4. Prompts for Git branch name (prepopulated with current branch)
5. Warns about uncommitted changes if present
6. Executes deployment for all flows simultaneously
7. Shows progress notification with group name and flow count
8. Provides workflow URL link upon successful initiation

**Example Group Deployment:**
```
Group path: "data-processing/etl"
Matches flows with grouping: ["data-processing", "etl"]
Action: Deploys customer_etl, transaction_etl, sales_etl (all flows in that group)
```

**Benefits of Group Deployment:**
- **Efficiency**: Deploy related flows together in one operation
- **Consistency**: Ensure all flows in a logical group are deployed to the same environment
- **Organization**: Leverage your existing flow grouping structure
- **Progress Tracking**: Single progress notification for the entire group operation

#### Environment Promotion

Move deployments from one environment to the next (e.g., dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production).

**Promotion workflow:**
- Promotes flows through predefined environment chains
- Maintains version history and traceability
- Validates promotion rules defined in SDK

**How to promote:**

1. **From Flow Level**:

   - Right-click on a flow
   - Click "Promote Flow" or rocket icon (üöÄ)
   - Promotes from the flow's current environment to the next

2. **From Environment Level**:

   - Right-click on a specific environment
   - Click "Promote Flow" or rocket icon (üöÄ)
   - Promotes from that environment to the next

3. **Via Command Palette**:

   - Select flow or environment
   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "ACME: Promote Flow"

**Promotion process:**

1. Identifies source and target environments
2. Validates promotion eligibility
3. Calls SDK's PromoteWorkflow object
4. Shows progress notification
5. Updates tree to reflect new deployment state

#### Promoting Flow Groups

**How to promote flow groups:**

1. **Via Command Palette**:

   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run "ACME: Promote Flow Group"
   - Enter the group path (e.g., "backend/data/etl")
   - Review the list of flows that will be promoted
   - Specify source environment (e.g., "dev", "staging")
   - Specify target environment (e.g., "staging", "prod")
   - Confirm promotion

2. **Via Tree View Context Menu**:

   - Right-click on any group folder in the ACME Resources tree
   - Select "Promote All Flows in Group" (rocket icon üöÄ)
   - Review and confirm the promotion

**Group Promotion Process:**

1. Extension validates prerequisites (Git state, SDK configuration)
2. Finds all flows matching the exact group path
3. Shows confirmation dialog listing all flows to be promoted
4. Prompts for source environment to promote from
5. Prompts for target environment to promote to
6. Prompts for Git branch name (prepopulated with current branch)
7. Executes promotion for all flows simultaneously
8. Shows progress notification with group name, environment flow, and flow count
9. Provides workflow URL link upon successful initiation

**Example Group Promotion:**
```
Group path: "data-processing/etl"
Source environment: "dev"
Target environment: "staging"
Matches flows: customer_etl, transaction_etl, sales_etl
Action: Promotes all flows from dev to staging environment
```

**Benefits of Group Promotion:**
- **Coordination**: Promote related flows together maintaining consistency
- **Efficiency**: Single operation instead of multiple individual promotions
- **Environment Management**: Ensure entire logical groups move through environments together
- **Workflow Integration**: Leverages existing promotion workflows and environment chains

## SDK Integration Architecture

### How the Extension Communicates with acme-portal-sdk

The ACME Portal extension acts as a bridge between VS Code and the acme-portal-sdk, using a sophisticated integration architecture:

#### Communication Flow

```
VS Code Extension (TypeScript)
    ‚Üì
Python Script Executor
    ‚Üì
SDK Object Runner (Python)
    ‚Üì
acme-portal-sdk Objects
    ‚Üì
External Systems (Git, APIs, etc.)
```

#### Key Components

**1. Python Script Executor**
- Manages Python environment and script execution
- Handles cross-platform compatibility
- Provides error handling and logging

**2. SDK Object Runner** 
- Bridge script that imports and executes SDK objects
- Located at `src/scripts/sdk_object_runner.py`
- Handles JSON serialization of results
- Manages module imports from `.acme_portal_sdk` directory

**3. SDK Objects Used**
- **FlowFinder**: Discovers and catalogs flows in the project
- **DeployWorkflow**: Handles flow deployment operations
- **PromoteWorkflow**: Manages environment promotions
- **Flow Comparison**: Compares flow versions across environments

### Data Flow and Parameters

#### Flow Discovery Process

**Extension ‚Üí SDK Flow:**
1. Extension calls `FindFlows.scanForFlows()`
2. TypeScript invokes `SdkObjectRunner.runSdkObject()`
3. Python script imports `FlowFinder` from `.acme_portal_sdk/flow_finder`
4. SDK scans project for flows and returns metadata
5. Extension receives JSON with flow details

**Data Returned:**
```typescript
interface FlowDetails {
    name: string;                    // Display name
    original_name: string;           // Name as defined in code
    description: string;             // Flow description
    obj_type: string;                // Object type (function, method)
    obj_name: string;                // Object name
    obj_parent_type: string;         // Container type (class, module)
    obj_parent: string;              // Container name
    id: string;                      // Unique identifier
    module: string;                  // Python module name
    source_path: string;             // Absolute path to source file
    source_relative: string;         // Relative path from project root
    import_path: string;             // Python import path
    grouping: string[];              // Organizational grouping
    child_attributes?: Record<string, any>; // Additional metadata
}
```

#### Deployment Process

**Parameters Passed to SDK:**
```typescript
{
    flows_to_deploy: string[];       // List of flow names
    ref: string;                     // Git branch/tag/commit
    additional_context?: Record<string, any>; // Extra metadata
}
```

**Extension ‚Üí SDK Flow:**
1. Extension gathers deployment parameters
2. Calls `FlowDeployer.deployFlows()` with parameters
3. SDK executes deployment workflow
4. Returns deployment URL or error information

#### Promotion Process

**Parameters Passed to SDK:**
```typescript
{
    flows_to_promote: string[];      // Flows to promote
    source_environment: string;      // Current environment
    target_environment: string;      // Destination environment
    additional_context?: Record<string, any>; // Extra metadata
}
```

#### Deployment Discovery

**Extension ‚Üí SDK Flow:**
1. Extension calls `FindDeployments.scanForDeployments()`
2. SDK queries external systems (APIs, databases)
3. Returns current deployment state across environments

**Data Returned:**
```typescript
interface DeploymentDetails {
    flow_name: string;               // Associated flow name
    environment: string;             // Target environment
    branch: string;                  // Git branch
    commit_sha: string;              // Git commit
    deployment_id: string;           // Unique deployment ID
    status: string;                  // Deployment status
    url?: string;                    // External URL
    timestamp: string;               // Deployment time
    metadata?: Record<string, any>;  // Additional details
}
```

### Error Handling and Validation

#### Precondition Checking

Before any SDK operation, the extension validates:

1. **Python Environment**: Correct interpreter selected
2. **SDK Installation**: acme-portal-sdk package available
3. **Project Structure**: `.acme_portal_sdk` directory exists
4. **Git Repository**: Valid Git repo with remote origin
5. **Project Configuration**: SDK properly initialized

#### Error Types and Handling

**Configuration Errors:**
- Missing or incorrect flows path
- Invalid Python interpreter
- Missing SDK installation

**Runtime Errors:**
- Python execution failures
- SDK module import errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication problems

**Data Errors:**
- Invalid flow definitions
- Malformed SDK responses
- Missing required metadata

### Customization and Extension

#### Custom SDK Objects

The architecture supports custom SDK objects:

1. **Add Custom Module**: Place in `.acme_portal_sdk` directory
2. **Implement Required Interface**: Follow SDK patterns
3. **Update Extension**: Modify TypeScript to call new objects

#### Configuration Options

SDK behavior can be customized through:
- **Environment Variables**: Python environment configuration
- **Config Files**: SDK-specific configuration
- **Extension Settings**: VS Code extension preferences

### Security Considerations

#### Data Handling
- **No Credential Storage**: Extension doesn't store sensitive data
- **Temporary Files**: JSON data files cleaned up after use
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Python scripts run in controlled environment

#### Network Access
- **SDK Managed**: All external communication through SDK
- **No Direct API Calls**: Extension doesn't make direct network requests
- **Authentication**: Handled by SDK configuration

### Troubleshooting SDK Integration

#### Common Issues

**Import Errors:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'acme_portal_sdk'
```
**Solution**: Verify Python interpreter and SDK installation

**Permission Errors:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```
**Solution**: Check file permissions and Python environment

**JSON Parse Errors:**
```
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value
```
**Solution**: Check SDK object return values and error logs

#### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Output Panel**: Select "ACME Portal" for detailed logs
2. **Verify Python Execution**: Test SDK objects manually
3. **Review SDK Configuration**: Check `.acme_portal_sdk` setup
4. **Test Network Connectivity**: Ensure external systems accessible

For more details on SDK setup and configuration, see the [acme-portal-sdk documentation](https://blackwhitehere.github.io/acme-portal-sdk/).

## Workflow Examples

### Typical Development Workflow

**1. Development Phase**
```
üìÅ My Flow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç dev (current: feature/new-logic)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üåø feature/new-logic
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä Deployed 2 hours ago
```

- Edit flow files in VS Code
- Refresh the tree view to see changes
- Deploy to dev environment for testing
- Verify functionality in development

**2. Testing and Staging**
```
üìÅ My Flow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç dev (feature/new-logic deployed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç staging (ready for promotion)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç production (current version)
```

- Promote from dev to staging
- Perform integration testing
- Compare versions between staging and production
- Review deployment differences

**3. Production Release**
```
üìÅ My Flow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç dev (‚úì deployed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç staging (‚úì tested)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üåç production (üöÄ promoting...)
```

- Final review and approval
- Promote to production
- Monitor deployment status
- Verify production functionality

### Multi-Environment Management

**1. Viewing All Environments**
- Expand flows to see all environments
- Check deployment status across environments
- Identify which environments need updates

**2. Selective Promotion**
- Choose specific flows for promotion
- Skip environments when necessary
- Manage different release schedules

**3. Version Control Integration**
- Track which Git branches are deployed where
- Compare code differences between environments
- Manage feature branch deployments

### Group-Based Workflow

**1. Coordinated Group Deployment**
```
üìÅ Data Processing Group (data/etl)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîÑ customer_etl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîÑ transaction_etl  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üîÑ sales_etl
```

- Develop related flows together in the same group
- Deploy entire group to development environment at once
- Test group functionality as a cohesive unit
- Promote entire group through environments together

**2. Group Release Management**
```
Group: "data/etl" (3 flows)
Dev ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
All flows promoted together maintaining consistency
```

- Coordinate release schedules for interdependent flows
- Ensure version alignment across related components
- Simplify rollback operations when needed
- Maintain operational consistency

### Emergency Response Workflow

**1. Hotfix Deployment**
```
main (production) ‚Üí hotfix/urgent-fix (dev) ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production
```

- Create hotfix branch
- Deploy directly to dev for testing
- Fast-track through staging
- Emergency promotion to production

**2. Rollback Scenario**
- Compare current production with previous stable version
- Identify problematic changes
- Deploy previous stable version if needed

## Tips and Best Practices

### Organization and Structure

**Project Organization**
- Keep flows in a dedicated, consistently named directory
- Use descriptive flow names that reflect functionality
- Maintain consistent directory structure across projects
- Group related flows using SDK grouping features

**Flow Grouping Strategy**
- Use meaningful group hierarchies that reflect your business domains
- Keep group names concise and descriptive
- Align grouping with your team's organizational structure
- Consider operational boundaries when defining groups

**Example Grouping Structure:**
```python
# Customer data processing flows
grouping = ["data", "customer", "processing"]

# Machine learning model flows  
grouping = ["ml", "models", "training"]

# Reporting and analytics flows
grouping = ["reporting", "analytics", "daily"]
```

**Benefits of Proper Grouping:**
- **Bulk Operations**: Deploy or promote entire logical groups at once
- **Organization**: Easy navigation and discovery of related flows
- **Team Coordination**: Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries
- **Environment Management**: Coordinate releases of interdependent flows

**Naming Conventions**
```
flows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-processing/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etl_customer_data.py      # grouping: ["data", "customer", "etl"]
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ etl_transaction_data.py   # grouping: ["data", "transaction", "etl"]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ml-pipelines/

### Development Best Practices

**Code Quality**
- Write comprehensive flow documentation
- Include meaningful descriptions in flow definitions
- Use type hints and proper error handling
- Follow Python coding standards

**Version Control**
- Commit changes before deploying
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Tag important releases
- Maintain clean Git history

**Testing Strategy**
- Test flows in development environment first
- Verify all dependencies are properly configured
- Validate data integrity after deployments
- Monitor flow execution in each environment

### Deployment Practices

**Pre-Deployment Checklist**
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] Configuration validated
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Deployment Strategy**
1. **Dev First**: Always deploy to development environment first
2. **Incremental Promotion**: Move through environments systematically
3. **Validation Gates**: Verify functionality at each stage
4. **Monitoring**: Watch deployment progress and logs

**Post-Deployment**
- Monitor flow execution
- Check deployment dashboards
- Verify data flow integrity
- Update documentation if needed

### Troubleshooting Workflows

**Common Issue Resolution**

**1. Flows Not Appearing**
```bash
# Check flows path configuration
# Verify SDK installation
# Refresh tree view
# Check Output panel for errors
```

**2. Deployment Failures**
```bash
# Review error messages in notifications
# Check Output panel for detailed logs  
# Verify Git repository state
# Validate SDK configuration
```

**3. Environment Sync Issues**
```bash
# Refresh tree view
# Compare versions across environments
# Check external deployment systems
# Verify network connectivity
```

### Integration with Other Tools

### Performance Optimization

**Large Projects**
- Configure appropriate flows path to limit scanning
- Use refresh sparingly for large flow directories
- Organize flows hierarchically for better navigation
- Consider splitting large projects into multiple workspaces

**Network Operations**
- Be patient with deployment operations
- Monitor progress notifications
- Cancel operations if needed
- Use refresh to update status after external changes

### Security Considerations

**Credentials and Secrets**
- Never commit credentials to source control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Configure SDK authentication properly
- Follow organizational security policies

**Access Control**
- Ensure proper permissions for deployment operations
- Use appropriate Git access controls
- Validate environment-specific access rights
- Monitor deployment activities
