## SDK Integration Architecture

### How the Extension Communicates with acme-portal-sdk

The ACME Portal extension acts as a bridge between VS Code and the acme-portal-sdk, using a sophisticated integration architecture:

#### Communication Flow

```
VS Code Extension (TypeScript)
    ‚Üì
Python Script Executor
    ‚Üì
SDK Object Runner (Python)
    ‚Üì
acme-portal-sdk Objects
    ‚Üì
External Systems (Git, APIs, etc.)
```

#### Key Components

**1. Python Script Executor**
- Manages Python environment and script execution
- Handles cross-platform compatibility
- Provides error handling and logging

**2. SDK Object Runner** 
- Bridge script that imports and executes SDK objects
- Located at `src/scripts/sdk_object_runner.py`
- Handles JSON serialization of results
- Manages module imports from `.acme_portal_sdk` directory

**3. SDK Objects Used**
- **FlowFinder**: Discovers and catalogs flows in the project
- **DeployWorkflow**: Handles flow deployment operations
- **PromoteWorkflow**: Manages environment promotions
- **Flow Comparison**: Compares flow versions across environments

### Data Flow and Parameters

#### Flow Discovery Process

**Extension ‚Üí SDK Flow:**
1. Extension calls `FindFlows.scanForFlows()`
2. TypeScript invokes `SdkObjectRunner.runSdkObject()`
3. Python script imports `FlowFinder` from `.acme_portal_sdk/flow_finder`
4. SDK scans project for flows and returns metadata
5. Extension receives JSON with flow details

**Data Returned:**
```typescript
interface FlowDetails {
    name: string;                    // Display name
    original_name: string;           // Name as defined in code
    description: string;             // Flow description
    obj_type: string;                // Object type (function, method)
    obj_name: string;                // Object name
    obj_parent_type: string;         // Container type (class, module)
    obj_parent: string;              // Container name
    id: string;                      // Unique identifier
    module: string;                  // Python module name
    source_path: string;             // Absolute path to source file
    source_relative: string;         // Relative path from project root
    import_path: string;             // Python import path
    grouping: string[];              // Organizational grouping
    child_attributes?: Record<string, any>; // Additional metadata
}
```

#### Deployment Process

**Parameters Passed to SDK:**
```typescript
{
    flows_to_deploy: string[];       // List of flow names
    ref: string;                     // Git branch/tag/commit
    additional_context?: Record<string, any>; // Extra metadata
}
```

**Extension ‚Üí SDK Flow:**
1. Extension gathers deployment parameters
2. Calls `FlowDeployer.deployFlows()` with parameters
3. SDK executes deployment workflow
4. Returns deployment URL or error information

#### Promotion Process

**Parameters Passed to SDK:**
```typescript
{
    flows_to_promote: string[];      // Flows to promote
    source_environment: string;      // Current environment
    target_environment: string;      // Destination environment
    additional_context?: Record<string, any>; // Extra metadata
}
```

#### Deployment Discovery

**Extension ‚Üí SDK Flow:**
1. Extension calls `FindDeployments.scanForDeployments()`
2. SDK queries external systems (APIs, databases)
3. Returns current deployment state across environments

**Data Returned:**
```typescript
interface DeploymentDetails {
    flow_name: string;               // Associated flow name
    environment: string;             // Target environment
    branch: string;                  // Git branch
    commit_sha: string;              // Git commit
    deployment_id: string;           // Unique deployment ID
    status: string;                  // Deployment status
    url?: string;                    // External URL
    timestamp: string;               // Deployment time
    metadata?: Record<string, any>;  // Additional details
}
```

### Error Handling and Validation

#### Precondition Checking

Before any SDK operation, the extension validates:

1. **Python Environment**: Correct interpreter selected
2. **SDK Installation**: acme-portal-sdk package available
3. **Project Structure**: `.acme_portal_sdk` directory exists
4. **Git Repository**: Valid Git repo with remote origin
5. **Project Configuration**: SDK properly initialized

#### Error Types and Handling

**Configuration Errors:**
- Missing or incorrect flows path
- Invalid Python interpreter
- Missing SDK installation

**Runtime Errors:**
- Python execution failures
- SDK module import errors
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication problems

**Data Errors:**
- Invalid flow definitions
- Malformed SDK responses
- Missing required metadata

### Customization and Extension

#### Custom SDK Objects

The architecture supports custom SDK objects:

1. **Add Custom Module**: Place in `.acme_portal_sdk` directory
2. **Implement Required Interface**: Follow SDK patterns
3. **Update Extension**: Modify TypeScript to call new objects

#### Configuration Options

SDK behavior can be customized through:
- **Environment Variables**: Python environment configuration
- **Config Files**: SDK-specific configuration
- **Extension Settings**: VS Code extension preferences

### Security Considerations

#### Data Handling
- **No Credential Storage**: Extension doesn't store sensitive data
- **Temporary Files**: JSON data files cleaned up after use
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Python scripts run in controlled environment

#### Network Access
- **SDK Managed**: All external communication through SDK
- **No Direct API Calls**: Extension doesn't make direct network requests
- **Authentication**: Handled by SDK configuration

### Troubleshooting SDK Integration

#### Common Issues

**Import Errors:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'acme_portal_sdk'
```
**Solution**: Verify Python interpreter and SDK installation

**Permission Errors:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```
**Solution**: Check file permissions and Python environment

**JSON Parse Errors:**
```
JSONDecodeError: Expecting value
```
**Solution**: Check SDK object return values and error logs

#### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Output Panel**: Select "ACME Portal" for detailed logs
2. **Verify Python Execution**: Test SDK objects manually
3. **Review SDK Configuration**: Check `.acme_portal_sdk` setup
4. **Test Network Connectivity**: Ensure external systems accessible
